      <p>Dr. Cerrito's research demonstrates that by examining the layers in teeth, or "tooth rings," we can uncover evidence of an individual's medical history, biological history, and significant personal events. We began by integrating the fundamental concepts of her research, which propose that layering is a natural occurrence in many living organisms, revealing insights into their history through the accumulation of layers over time.</p>`,
